# OmniPoint _ Urban PopUp Events Mapping App @ Team of 四魂之玉ShikonNoTama

# Description
OmniPoint（泛波点） is an application focusing on social event maps and event communities' online catch-up.
Since our urban life is formed by private and social events in the cities as the life containter, event locations is a catalyzing element not only in social life but also in urbanism development. Mapping events out and tracking the updates after the events would fascinate the urban life and challenge the traditional events management applciations. We believe this application could be a radical idea for testing.  
The project target is to enhance exposure of events to the appropriate groups or markets and orient event's activities in a more efficient way.
